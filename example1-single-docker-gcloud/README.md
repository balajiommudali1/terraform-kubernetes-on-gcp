## Prepare

First of all make sure you're in the right directory:

```sh
cd example1-single-docker-gcloud
```

## Setup

Switch to your GCP project (using its ID) and pick a zone:

```sh
gcloud config set project playground-195011
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
```

## Hello world deployment

```sh
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --allow tcp:80 --target-tags http-server
gcloud beta compute instances create-with-container nginx-docker --machine-type g1-small --tags http-server --container-image docker.io/nginxdemos/hello
```

You should see some output similar to this:

```
Creating firewall.../Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/playground-195011/global/firewalls/allow-http].
Creating firewall...done.
NAME        NETWORK  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW   DENY
allow-http  default  INGRESS    1000      tcp:80

```

Now you can open the `EXTERNAL_IP` from your output in a browser window and you
should see the NGINX "Hello World" page.

Once you're finished basking in the glory of your first deployment, let's delete
it and move on ðŸ˜º

```sh
gcloud compute instances delete nginx-docker
```

You should see some output similar to this:

```
The following instances will be deleted. Any attached disks configured
 to be auto-deleted will be deleted unless they are attached to any
other instances or the `--keep-disks` flag is given and specifies them
 for keeping. Deleting a disk is irreversible and any data on the disk
 will be lost.

Do you want to continue (Y/n)?  y

Deleted [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/playground-195011/zones/us-west1-b/instances/nginx-docker].
```

## App deployment

First make sure you have a fresh build (see above).

Then tag it and push it to GCP Container Registry:

TODO

Then you're ready to update the container in the VM:
